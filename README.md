# Golang Network Port Scanner [![Travis-CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/P-A-R-U-S/Golang-Network-Scanner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/P-A-R-U-S/Golang-Network-Scanner) 

Simple command line tool to scan network ports. Command line tool was done as part of technical interview and as example for article on HabraHabr.ru.

The main requirement for the tool to accept individual IP, range of IPs in regular format or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). The utility are free to use or change.

There was no requirement to build like a package, but you can easily converted it. Enjoy coding.
